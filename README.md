# Shushrusha-Pharma
The aim of the project is the management of the database of the pharmaceutical shop. This is done by  creating a file of the available medicines in the shop. 
The main objective of our program is to  create a computer based pharmacy system that will take data from the user and select the drug to the  user at a reasonable price.
Our program will work exactly to create medicine recept but the main  difference is that it will not be controlled by any people rather it will be completely controlled 
by a  computer. Now when a user run our program, our program will ask their name, mobile  number and location. Then there will be a search option for people to find their necessary medicine and  other things like baby  and women care products, device, personal  care products etc. which will be listed and sorted with accurate price. Then users can select  the desired drug items, add them to cart and then proceed to payment by BKash or Card. According to  the customer's location, the admin panel will give the necessary medicine home delivery through the  transport system. It will also collect information on all daily transactions.

Why do we use it?
Most of our people buy medicine from the local medical shop. They need to go to medicine stores to buy the 
specific medicine prescribed by the specialized doctors. Sometimes all prescribed medicines are not available 
in local Pharmacies therefore people need to go to other areas to buy the medicines. It is very time 
consuming and people need to spend money as well for this. In our country, traffic jams are a very big 
problem. People waste longer time on the road due to traffic jams. Here most of the pharmacies are closed 
at night time but sometimes in an emergency situation medicine is very essential. In this case an online web 
based e-commerce medicine delivery system is needed very much. In addition, currently the whole world is 
suffering due to COVID-19 pandemic. Coronavirus is very contagious which we all know. In this pandemic 
time it is not risk free to go out to buy medicine from the pharmacies. Due to COVID-19, medicine scarcity is 
also an important issue. In this situation, an online medicine delivery system can play an important role. 
Besides medicine, here customers /users can also find other health care products like food supplements, 
birth control products, hair care products, skincare products, beauty products, etc. On the other hand, 
customers/ users get 5% discount on full payment. People can order their required medicines or other 
medical related available items from online and the delivery support will provide the products door to door 
for the users. By using this system now users can get their needed medicine without leaving home. They can 
save money and they do not need to go out in this pandemic situation to buy medicine. In this crucial 
situation, the online medicine delivery system is very helpful and it will act as a blessing for the people
